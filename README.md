# ApplicationState-C-Sharp
Multiple Users Global Data

This means that when a user stores a number in the "Application State", it won't time out using the Web.Config 
file settings, it will lose it's data stored when the application hosting the website restarts.
So for example User1 enters in 3, then User2 comes back the next day and can access that data number 3 because
it's stored in the Application State variable, which is available to multiple users, so the session unique key 
generated by the server and displayed in the URL, will NOT be the same key, but will still store the number 3 
in it because it's available to multiple users and is global data because it's shared across all web pages.

Note!
1. Application State variables are available across all pages, and across all sessions. Like Multi User Global Data.
2. Application State variables are stored on the web server. 
3. Application State variables are cleared, when the process hosting the application is restarted.
